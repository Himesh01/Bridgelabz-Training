## Week 4 (Java IO Streams)

## 🗓 Introduction to Java Collections & Stream
**(Date: 23-Jan-2026)**

-	Java IOStreams Overview             
**Branch:** `java-iostreams-practice`

Studied the Java Collections Framework to manage groups of objects efficiently using built-in data structures. Learned the difference between Collection and Map interfaces and their real-world use cases.

## 📅 Day 28 – Java Collections & CSV Data Handling  
**(23 Jan 2026)**

### 🔹 Java Collections Overview
- Studied **Java Collections Framework**
- Understood differences between:
  - `Collection` vs `Map`
  - `List`, `Set`, `Queue`
  - `HashMap`, `TreeMap`
- Applied collections for efficient data management

### 🔹 CSV Data Handling
- Learned CSV structure and real-world use cases
- Read CSV files using:
  - `BufferedReader` (manual parsing)
  - OpenCSV (`CSVReader`)
- Wrote CSV files using:
  - `BufferedWriter`
  - OpenCSV (`CSVWriter`)
- Parsed rows using:
  - `String.split()`
  - `CsvToBean` (CSV → Java Object mapping)
- Implemented data validation:
  - Numeric field checks
  - Regex-based column validation
- Practiced:
  - Filtering and searching records
  - Sorting and updating data
  - Merging multiple CSV files
- Implemented chunk-based reading for large CSV files
- Generated reports and export files
- Solved practice problems and committed all work
